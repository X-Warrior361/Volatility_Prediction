# Volatility Prediction on Wheat Futures Prices

This repository is a personal group project created by my friend Ayush and me, where we predict the volatility of wheat futures prices over the years in both the US and Indian markets.




## Progress
- No signigicant autocorrelation detected in returns of daily, weekly and monthly US wheat prices or Indian wheat prices.
- Extracted the temperature and precipitation details for top 3 wheat producing states of US (North Dakota, Kansas, Montana) and India(Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab), respectively.
